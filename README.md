# LunarCModifierJ
This is LunarCModifier, but coded in Java instead of python. I do not know java very well, so this code is just stack overflow pretty much. This is just used as a learning experience so I can learn more java.

Please check out the original repo as it has more information about what LunarCModifier is / does and how to use it.

### How to use
You need java 18 and you need to run "javac Main.java" which will create a Main.class file (one is already provided). After that, just run "java Main" inside of the same directory in a terminal, and it will run the program.
